Code Refactor

Websites need to be accessible by all sort of people. Therefore, websites need to be modified in a way that people with disabilities have no issues accesing the website.
Web accessibility is really important to make that happen, "using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards". This ensures that any person can access the website without having any sort of issue. An accesible website keeps a business moving.
Also, I was able to moditifed/add sematic html. I achieved this by changing or adding several tags to the code without neccesary changing anything to the website.
I was able to search all sort of ways to complete this assignment. I learned many new skills along the way but I also find out how many different codes could be wrriten and neccesary not be wrong. But, it is really imporant to try and keep a code clean to be able to go back to it in near future and not have any problem reading it.
